# Tyler's Blueprint

## Everything is figureoutable  
  - There are very few times where we can't recover. Learning from mistakes is one of my favorite part of taking big risks.  
## I think in worse case scenarios  
  - Very early on I took the saying "What's the worst case scenario"? to heart. If the worst case scenario is in mind, then it can't actually be that bad.  
## I'm hopelessly optimistic  
  - I truly and deeply think things will "just work out". With the worst case scenario thought of, and knowing we can recover, why wouldn't we be able to work it out?  
## Team > Org  
  - Probably comes from a sports background but I'll always look out for my team mates over the organization. It makes me a very poor company secret keeper for little things I feel my team would benefit from.  
## I value time away from work  
  - I'll put in the occasional late nights to get a project done if needed. However, when it's time to be done with work, I don't feel bad shutting down my work computer until the next day. I try to lead by example for this as well.  
## I tend to over-think written communication ðŸ˜¬  
  - When we read things, we can inflect our own emotions and feelings into the writing. I tend to over-think how what I'm writing will be received. As a result I usually over use emojis ðŸ¥³ ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜ƒ  
## I'm a tinkerer  
  - I'm constantly playing with different technologies, including frontend, backend, DBs, CI & CD. I love to keep a backlog of personal projects using different technologies. I feel like the things I learn from these are valuable to keep my skills sharp and learn new paradigms.  
## I'm a teacher at heart  
  - Sometimes that can be annoying.  
## My mouth doesn't always catch up to my brain  
  - "What I meant to say was" will happen a lot.
